# libcv

![](https://i.imgur.com/ikrY1gE.jpg)

A compact cross-platform Computer Vision library written in C/C++ during the duration of a Computer Vision course in the context of my licentiate degree in Computer Systems Engineering. This library was later used to develop two different courseworks: a traffic sign detector and a moving fruit counter in a assembly line.

 ## Features
 
 * Check the [library header](https://github.com/ibbgomes/libcv/blob/master/src/libcv.h) to consult the available routines. 
 
 ## Requeriments
 
  * A small amount of routines uses data structures from the [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) library.
